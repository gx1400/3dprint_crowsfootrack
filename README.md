# Rack for Crows Foot (Flare Nut) socket wrenches

Printed rack for Sunex Flare Nut socket wrenches

SAE: [Sunex 9708](https://www.zoro.com/sunex-tools-38-drive-sae-crowfoot-wrench-set-8-pcs-38-drve-8-pcs-9708/i/G2314151)  

Metric: [Sunex 9710M](https://www.zoro.com/sunex-tools-metric-flare-nut-wrench-set-38-in-10-pc-9710m/i/G4514645/)

Design driven from measurements into parameter variables in F360.  Measured throat opening, depth, thickness, and width.  Pics below showing measurement method.

I ordered these [Magnets from amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07MV6M12H) to see if the rack benefits, but the wrenches are pretty heavy, so may not be necessary.  As of 2/17/2021, have not received or tested.
